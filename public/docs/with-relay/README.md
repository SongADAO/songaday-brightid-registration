# Song a DAO - Snapshot Registration

## Reason for Registration

<section>
Song a DAO is different than most DAOs you are already familiar with.  Unlike what has become the traditional DAO format, where the voting power of an individual is tied to the number of tokens they have, Song a DAO is setup so that each person has one vote regardless of their total number of NFTs held.  This is because Song a DAO is a registered CO-OP in the state of Colorado.  The voting structure reflects the legal status of the organization.

This means is that we need a way to determine that no person can ever cast more than one vote. The biggest hurdle here is protecting the vote from people who buy multiple NFTs and hold each one in a separate wallet. To accomplish this we are using a service called <a href="https://www.brightid.org/" target="_blank">BrightID</a>, which provides a method for verifying a person is an actual person and combat the situation of one anon pretending to be multiple people.

## Registration App

<section>
There are a number of steps in the registration process. We've created a simple registration dapp for you to use to complete each step in the process.

It can be accessed at <a href="https://idchain.songadao.org/brightid-registration/" target="_blank">Song a Day Registration App</a>

The rest of this documentation explains what the steps you will be doing in the registration app are for.
